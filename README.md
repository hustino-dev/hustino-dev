## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my profile!

Hello! My name is Justine Carl Vasquez. I am from Cavite State University currently taking BS Computer Science.

I'm on my 3rd year but still all I know was the basics. So I decided to join github and apply for student pack as my first step for improving my skills. 

Currently I have knowledge about java and MySql.

I really wanted to learn coding so bad, so I love to join different communities where I can develop more skills and knowledge.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, java, html, css, and javascript.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Need cure for boredom? start learning coding/programming as a hobby and become pro then earn eventually. (not a fan fact)
